/**
 * @brief Duo Comparison Tool Capability Class
 *
 * CVcfAnalyzer object is a tool itself that performs variant comparison operation. Its output is very close to vcfeval.
 * The differences:
 * 1. Variants with 0/0 genotype is eliminated from output while vcfeval keeps them
 * 2. Cutoff limits during variant replay is configurable with VBT while it is fixed in vcfeval
 * 3. In -ref-overlap mode, VBT does a clever trimming strategy that can find more TPs in repetitive regions rather than naive approach of vcfeval
